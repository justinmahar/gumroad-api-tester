## Get Started

**[Open the Gumroad API Tester](https://justinmahar.github.io/gumroad-api-tester/?path=/story/tools-gumroad-api--tester)**

## Documentation

Read the **[official documentation](https://justinmahar.github.io/gumroad-api-tester/)**.

## Overview

[Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) is a platform that allows you to sell digital products such as books, memberships, courses, and more.

Using this tool, you can test out the [Gumroad API](https://app.gumroad.com/api) using your [access token](https://app.gumroad.com/settings/advanced#application-form). This tool can also be helpful if you need to make changes not supported via the website, such as adding resource subscriptions.

All v2 endpoints are available for quick selection, or you can manually enter things if you'd like. Some parameters are optional—be sure to reference the [API docs](https://app.gumroad.com/api) when in doubt.

When retrieving products, buy buttons are shown so that you can test product purchases right from within this testing tool.

Try the `GET: /user` endpoint for a quick test of your access token.
