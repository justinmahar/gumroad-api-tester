**Important: Be sure to add all new frontmatter specs to this file and `src/data/MdxContent.ts`.**

This file has all frontmatter fields defined so that their types can be inferred by Gatsby's GraphQL system.

This file also makes all frontmatter in MDX files optional except for `title`.

This MDX file is set as a partial, so it will not be generated as a page.

In any MDX file except this one:

- All fields except `title` are optional.
- Anything not specified, or set to `none`, is ignored.
- When not specified, slugs are created from titles. They are stripped of stop words, made lowercase, and all non-alphanumerics are converted to dashes.
- `partial` - Set to `true` to make MDX into a partial. No page will be created by Gatsby, and it can be included on any page using the `MdxPartial` component.
- `private` - Set to `true` to make MDX page private. It will not be included in `sitemap.xml` and its path will be prefixed with the `privatePagePathPrefix` value defined in `src/settings/settings.yml`.

See the [MDX Launchpad README](https://github.com/justinmahar/gatsby-starter-mdx-launchpad#included-frontmatter) for more information on frontmatter.
