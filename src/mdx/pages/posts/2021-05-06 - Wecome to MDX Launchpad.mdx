import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';

The main goal of this [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/) is to take care of several boilerplate pain points that get in the way of starting a new project, while still being flexible enough to be used as a starting point for a website, blog, or progressive web app.

This starter supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for pages and content. MDX lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents <Button size="sm">like so</Button>, and makes writing long-form content with components a blast. This remains an optional feature of the starter. Feel free to add new pages the good old Gatsby way!

Other features include TypeScript support, site settings, SEO and smart page slugs, private pages and content partials, lightweight blog features, redirects, PWA support, syntax highlighting, Google Analytics, and more!
